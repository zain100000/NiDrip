  "description": "The NiDrip backend, built with Node.js and Express, powers a centralized electronics e-commerce platform with Super Admin, Admin, and Customer roles. It provides secure authentication using JWT and two-factor authentication, along with role-based access control for platform security and management. The backend manages the complete product lifecycle, including product creation, pricing, inventory, image uploads, and availability. It handles order processing, debit card payments, shipping management, and real-time order status updates. Administrators can manage products, users, orders, and payments through a dedicated admin panel, while customers can browse, search, and purchase electronics seamlessly. NiDrip exposes a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs for users, products, carts, orders, payments, shipping, and notifications. It integrates Cloudinary for media storage and supports push notifications for order and delivery updates. Scalable and production-ready, the backend ensures secure data handling and seamless integration with the React Native mobile app and React.js admin panel",
